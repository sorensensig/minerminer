# minerminer
MinerMiner was developed as part of the course DECO7180 - Design Computing Studio 1 at the University of Queensland.

The team was tasked with using open APIs from the government of Queensland to build a novel website.
Please see the reports for further details.

## Live Demo
This website is not a final product. Please read the tutorial before you start the game as there is no onboarding process for the game otherwise.
